Reporting Bugs
==============

A list of known bugs can be found in the BUGS file.  Details of
compilation problems can be found in the INSTALL file.

If you find a bug which is not listed in these files please report it
to matteo.mezzadri3@studenti.unipr.it

All bug reports should include:

       The version number of GSL, and where you obtained it.
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used, including version number and compilation options
       A description of the bug behaviour
       A short program which reproducibly exercises the bug

It is useful if you can check whether the same problem occurs when the
program is compiled without optimization.  Thank you.

Any errors or omissions in the manual can also be reported to the
same address.
