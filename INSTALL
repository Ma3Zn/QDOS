Dependencies
============

    To be able to build and install properly QDOS you will need a GCC and GSL
properly installed on your system. Whilst for the first one is simply a
limitation of the makefile, and it can be corrected with small adjustement
enabling anyone to build QDOS with any C compiler the second requirement is
strict. QDOS has been developed with GSL 2.7.1 and I think that any version
including the ambient odev2 is compatible with it. The current stable version of
GSL is always available from ftp.gnu.org in the directory /pub/gnu/gsl. A list
of mirror sites can be found at http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html. The project
homepage is http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

Installation
============

    Once you have installed GSL, to compile and install QDOS you simply need to
perform the following step

    1. 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code

    2. Type 'make' to compile the package

    3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
       documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
       recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
       user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
       privileges, i.e., do step 2. without root privileges while step 3. with
       root privileges.

    4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
       source code directory by typing `make clean'.

    5. You can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed files. If you
       followed the instruction on the privileges of point 3. then you don't
       root privileges to perform a make clean while you need them while
       performing a make uninstall.

Custom Logic Recompilation
==========================

    If you have build your custom logic and you want to be able to exegute it
inside a QDOS circuit, the simplest way to make it avaible is to re-build and
re-install the code. So you need to only perform an ordinary installation.
Uninstallation of the sfotware and documentations is not needed before a
re-installation. Summing up do step 1. 2. and 3. of the paragraph before to have
at your disposal all the Custom Logic defined.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' installs the programs under `/usr/local/bin' and
the manual page under '/usr/share/man/man1'.
